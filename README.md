# Predicting House Prices With 'k' Nearest Neighbours Regression

This project predicts the house sales price using 'k' nearest neighbours regression.The algorithm uses ‘feature similarity’ to predict values of any new data points. This means that the new point is assigned a value based on how closely it resembles the points in the training set.The 'k' nearest neighbours of the new point are considered and the average of those 'k' values is taken to be the final prediction.
